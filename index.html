	<p class="solid"> &nbsp;For this simulation you will be using the <strong>Tesla</strong> Roadster to compete against Elon Musk but before that takes places it is important that you get some info regarding the <strong>Tesla</strong> Roadster.
	The <strong>Tesla</strong> Roadster goes from <em>0-60 in 1.9s</em>. The <strong>Tesla</strong> Roadster has a top speed of <em>250mph</em> and a range of <em>620mi</em> on a single charge. The <strong>Tesla </strong> Roadster is Designed for Performance and Aero Efficiency As an all-electric supercar, Roadster maximizes the potential of aerodynamic engineering—with record-setting performance and efficiency. The first supercar to set every performance record and still fit seating for four.
	Has a lightweight, removable Glass Roof stores in the trunk for an open-air, convertible driving experience. All these advantages is what makes the Tesla Roadster one of the most powerful cars on the plant even though it runs on electricity. That is why we are using this remarkable piece of engineering for our simulation </p>

  <h2 id="Education"> &nbsp;Education </h2>
  <p> &nbsp;Musk relocated to Canada in 1989 when he was 17 years old to attend Queen's University and escape being drafted into the South African military. That year, Musk became a citizen of Canada, in part because he believed it would be simpler to become an American citizen through that route. Musk left Canada in 1992 to pursue his studies in business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics then continued on to earn a second bachelor's degree in physics. Musk left Penn and enrolled at Stanford University in California to work for a PhD in energy physics. Musk moved to Stanford University in California to seek a PhD in energy physics after leaving Penn. He left Stanford after just two days to join the Internet boom, starting his first firm, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995. However, his decision was made at the exact right time. In 2002, Musk acceded to citizenship.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Zip2 </h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1995, Muskand his brother Kimbal Musk founded their first business, Zip2 Corporation. Zip2, an online city guide, quickly started contributing information to The New York Times and Chicago Tribune's new websites. For $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation acquired Zip2 in 1999.</p>

  <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; Paypal </h3>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Elon and Kimbal Musk founded the online financial services and payments firm X.com in 1999 using the proceeds from the sale of Zip2. The next year, X.com was acquired, which resulted in the birth of PayPal as we know it today.</p>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; SpaceX</h3>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, was formed by Musk in 2002 with the goal of developing spaceships for private space travel. In an effort to replace NASA's own space shuttle missions, NASA gave SpaceX a contract in 2008 to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station, with intentions to include crew transport in the future.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; Falcon 9 Rockets</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Musk and SpaceX created history on May 22, 2012 when they sent an unmanned capsule into space aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. It was the first time a commercial firm has flown a spacecraft to the International Space Station, and it carried 1,000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts who were stationed there. Musk was quoted as stating after the launch, "I feel really fortunate. It's comparable to winning the Super Bowl for us."</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An orbital distance at which a satellite would lock into an orbital path that matched the rotation of the Earth was reached by a Falcon 9 rocket in December 2013 with success. A second Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite was launched by SpaceX in February 2015 with the purpose of observing the severe solar emissions that have an impact on the Earth's electrical networks and communications infrastructure.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A reusable-parts-built Falcon 9 rocket successfully test-flew and landed in March 2017 at SpaceX, ushering in a new era of more reasonably priced space travel.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; An explosion that happened in November 2017 when the firm was testing its new Block 5 Merlin engine was a setback. No one was wounded, according to a statement from SpaceX, and the problem won't prevent the company from launching a new generation of Falcon 9 rockets as scheduled.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With the successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018, the business celebrated yet another significant event. The Falcon Heavy was created to lift massive payloads into orbit and perhaps act as a spacecraft for long space missions. It is equipped with multiple Falcon 9 rockets. Musk's cherry-red Tesla Roadster, which had cameras to "offer some amazing vistas" for the spacecraft's intended orbit around the sun, was loaded onto the Falcon Heavy for the test flight.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A new Block 5 Falcon rocket successfully landed on a drone ship in July 2018 for Space X less than nine minutes after takeoff.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;BFR Mission to Mars</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In September 2017, Musk unveiled a new concept for his BFR, a 31-engine monster topped by a spacecraft designed to accommodate at least 100 people. BFR is an abbreviation for either "Big F—-ing Rocket" or "Big Falcon Rocket." As part of his overall plan to colonise the Red Planet, Elon said that SpaceX intended to fly the first cargo flights to Mars with the craft in 2022.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The businessman gave a knowing gesture to his prior issues with meeting timelines when he said, in March 2018, to an audience at the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, that he intended to have the BFR ready for brief flights early the following year.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was revealed the following month that SpaceX will build a facility in the Port of Los Angeles to create and host the BFR. SpaceX found the port property to be the perfect location since, once finished, its enormous rocket can only be moved by barge or ship.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;Starlink Internet Satellites</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The U.S. government gave SpaceX approval to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit for the purpose of delivering Internet connectivity in late March 2018. The Starlink satellite network aims to increase competition in densely populated markets that are now controlled by one or two providers while simultaneously improving broadband service accessibility in remote regions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites, then in November of the same year, it launched a second payload of 60 satellites. Although this was a significant step forward for the Starlink project, the appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the possibility of thousands more to follow, alarmed astronomers who believed that the proliferation of satellites would make it more challenging to observe far-off objects in space.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tesla Motors</h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk is a co-founder, CEO, and product architect at Tesla Motors, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/about">a business founded in 2003</a> with a focus on mass-market, reasonably priced electric vehicles as well as battery goods and solar roofs. Musk is in charge of all aspects of product development, engineering, and design for the business.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;Roadster</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Five years after the company's founding, in March 2008, Tesla launched the Roadster, a sports vehicle with a lithium ion battery that allows it to go almost 250 miles between charges and accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under 3.7 seconds.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tesla Motors announced its first public offering in June 2010, generating $226 million thanks to a stake Daimler had purchased in the business and a strategic alliance with Toyota.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;Model S</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Model S, Tesla's first electric sedan <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/48131-tesla-model-s-is-10-a-look-back-at-its-legacy">that was apparently intended</a> to compete with the BMW 5 series, was originally introduced in August 2008. The Model S started out in production in 2012 with a starting price of $58,570. It was recognised by Motor Trend magazine as the 2013 Car of the Year due to its 265-mile range between charges.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tesla declared in April 2017 that it has surpassed General Motors to become the most valued American automaker. Tesla, which planned to increase production and release its Model 3 sedan later that year, benefited greatly from the news.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;Model 3</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Early in 2019, the Model 3 was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/02/28/tesla-launches-long-awaited-35-000-model-3/3020046002/">finally introduced</a> after lengthy production delays. The car's starting price of $35,000 made it much more affordable than Tesla's Model S and X electric sedans, which start at $69,500 and go up from there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk had originally planned to produce 5,000 brand-new Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of 2017, but he later pushed that target back to March 2018 and then to June as the new year began. Industry experts were not surprised by the announced delay because they were aware of the company's production issues; however, some questioned how long investors would be willing to wait. It also didn't stop Musk from obtaining an innovative new remuneration arrangement as CEO, in which he would be rewarded upon the achievement of increasing valuation goals based on $50 billion increments.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;By April 2018, it was reported that Musk had fired the engineering division's director in order to personally direct efforts there as Tesla was anticipated to fall short of first-quarter production forecasts. Musk said in a Twitter conversation with a reporter that it was crucial to "divide and conquer" in order to achieve production targets and that he was "back to sleeping at the factory."</p>
  <p>Musk hinted that the firm might restructure its management structure before announcing in June that Tesla was firing 9% of its workers while keeping its manufacturing division intact. Musk acknowledged that it was time to start making serious efforts toward turning a profit in an email to employees, explaining his decision to eliminate some "duplication of roles" in order to reduce costs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tesla said that it had achieved its objective of producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June 2018 while also generating an additional 2,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs, indicating that the reorganisation had paid off. Musk exclaimed, "We did it!" in a joyful email to the business. What a fantastic work, done by a fantastic crew.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk revealed that the company was finally releasing its standard Model 3 in February of the following year. Musk also announced that Tesla was switching to entirely online sales and giving customers the option to return their vehicles for a full refund within seven days or 1,000 miles.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;Semi Truck</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When the new Tesla Semi and Roadster were unveiled in the company's design studio in November 2017, Musk made another splash. The semi-truck claims a 500-mile range, a battery and motors made to last a million miles, and was originally scheduled to go into production in 2019 before being postponed.</p>

  <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;Model Y & New Roadster</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-y"> Musk unveiled </a>Tesla's eagerly anticipated Model Y in March 2019. The 300-mile driving range and 3.5-second 0 to 60 mph pace of the tiny crossover, which started shipping to consumers in March 2020.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;With a 0 to 60 duration of 1.9 seconds, the 2020 Roadster will surpass all other production vehicles in terms of speed.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp;SolarCity</h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In August 2016, a $2.6 billion agreement was finalised to unite Musk's electric car and solar energy businesses. This was part of Musk's ongoing efforts to create sustainable energy and goods for a larger customer base. In an all-stock agreement, Musk's Tesla Motors Inc. purchased SolarCity Corp., a business his cousins and he co-founded in 2006. He has the bulk of the stock in each company.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;"When used together, solar and storage perform optimally. A statement on Tesla's website regarding the partnership said, "As one business, Tesla (storage) and SolarCity (solar) can develop fully integrated residential, commercial, and grid-scale solutions that enhance the way energy is generated, stored, and consumed.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Boring Company</h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk established The Boring Company in January 2017, a business focused to drilling and constructing tunnels to lessen traffic on the streets. On the SpaceX facility near Los Angeles, he started by digging a test hole.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk published the first image of his company's development on his Instagram feed in late October of that year. He stated that it would take about four months for the 500-foot tunnel, which would typically run parallel to Interstate 405, to reach a length of two miles.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority awarded the business, now known as TBC, a $48.7 million contract in May 2019 for the construction of an underground Loop system to transport visitors around the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Twitter</h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Following months of back and forth, Musk finally <a href="https://www.wsj.com/story/twitter-purchased-by-elon-musk-how-it-went-down-72a07de3" >acquired Twitter</a> in October 2022 and was named the social media company's CEO.</p>

  <h2 id="Investigation">&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation</h2>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a tweet on August 7, 2018, Musk revealed a shocking revelation: "At $420, I'm thinking about taking Tesla private. funding arranged." Due to the SEC's inquiries into whether Musk had actually obtained the funds as reported, the revelation made the firm and its creator vulnerable to legal action. According to many lawsuits brought by investors, Musk's tweet was intended to ambush short sellers and influence stock prices.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tesla stock originally spiked in response to Musk's statement, but it eventually finished the day up 11%. In a message published as a follow-up on the business blog, the CEO referred to the decision to go private as "the best road forward." He pledged to keep his investment in the business and stated that he would establish a special fund to support the continued participation of all present investors.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Six days later, Musk released a statement to clarify his stance. In it, he cited his "funding secured" claim as the result of conversations with the managing director of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund. Later, he tweeted that he was developing a plan to take Tesla private with the help of Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake as financial consultants.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Rapper Azealia Banks said on Instagram that when she was a visitor at Elon Musk's house that day, she discovered that he was under the influence of LSD when he sent out his news-grabbing tweet. This is when the story took a peculiar turn. Banks claimed that she overheard Musk making calls to get the cash he claimed was already in place.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When it was revealed that two legal firms had been hired by Tesla's outside board to handle the SEC investigation and the CEO's ambitions to take the business private, the story soon took on a serious tone once more.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk said on August 24 that he had changed his mind and would not be taking the firm private, a day after meeting with the board. He listed the wish of the majority of directors to keep Tesla publicly traded as one of his justifications, along with the challenge of maintaining some of the major shareholders who were precluded from engaging in a private business. Others asserted that Musk was also affected by the unfavourable perception of an electric vehicle firm receiving funding from Saudi Arabia, a nation with a significant oil sector presence.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As part of a settlement with the SEC, Musk was required to pay a $20 million fine and vacate his position as Tesla's board chairman for a period of three years, it was revealed on September 29, 2018.</p>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Am considering taking Tesla private at $420.

  <h2 id="Inventions and Innovations Hyperloop">&nbsp; &nbsp;Inventions and Innovations Hyperloop</h2>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The "Hyperloop," an innovation by Elon Musk that would promote commuting between major cities while drastically reducing travel time, was unveiled in August 2013. The Hyperloop would move passengers in pods via a system of low-pressure tubes at speeds of up to 700 mph while being weatherproof and powered by renewable energy. Musk stated that the construction and operational readiness of the Hyperloop might take seven to ten years.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Despite Musk's promises that the Hyperloop will be safer than an aircraft or train and have an estimated cost of $6 billion (about one-tenth the cost of the rail system proposed by the state of California), his idea has been met with scepticism. However, the businessperson has made an effort to promote the advancement of this concept.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The inaugural Hyperloop Pod Competition took place at the SpaceX site in January 2017 after he launched a competition for teams to submit their designs for a Hyperloop pod prototype. A German student engineering team established a speed record of 284 mph in competition No. 3 in 2018, then the same team increased the record to 287 mph the following year.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp;High-Speed Train</h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition with The Boring Company in late November 2017, after Chicago Mayor <a href="https://www.biography.com/political-figures/rahm-emanuel"> Rahm Emanuel </a> requested proposals for the construction and operation of a high-speed rail line that would transport passengers from O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago in 20 minutes or less. The comparatively short course of the Chicago loop, he claimed, would make it distinct from his Hyperloop in that it would not necessitate drawing a vacuum to remove air friction.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk declared in the summer of 2018 that he will pay the $1 billion projected cost of building the 17-mile tunnel from the airport to downtown Chicago. But in late 2019, he said in a tweet that TBC will put its attention first on finishing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas, leaving plans for Chicago in doubt for the time being.</p>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp;Flanethrower</h3>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk has discovered a market for the flamethrowers produced by The Boring Company. He asserted that he sold 10,000 of them in a single day after making the announcement that they will be available for $500 each in late January 2018.</p>

  <h2 id="AI and Neuralink">&nbsp; &nbsp;AI & Neuralink</h2>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk has continued to explore his interest in artificial intelligence and has joined the charity OpenAI as co-chair. The research firm was established in late 2015, and its declared goal is to advance digital intelligence for the good of mankind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk was also said to be supporting a company named Neuralink in 2017, which aims to develop implants for the human brain that would allow individuals to integrate with software. During a conversation in July 2019, he went into more detail about the business's development and disclosed that its products would have a tiny chip that communicates to a smartphone through Bluetooth.</p>

  <h2 id="Relationship with Donald Trump">&nbsp; &nbsp;Relationship with Donald Trump</h2>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk was invited to attend <a href="https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump"> President Trump's </a> Strategy and Policy Forum in December 2016, and he joined Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative in January 2017. After Trump was elected, he and his aides found common ground as the new leader declared plans to undertake significant infrastructure improvements.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk defended his cooperation with the new government despite occasionally disagreeing with the president's contentious policies, like as the planned ban on immigrants from nations with a majority of Muslims. Early in 2017, he tweeted, "My aims are to expedite the world's transition to sustainable energy and to help make mankind a multi-planet civilisation, which will result in the creation of hundreds of thousands of employment and a more inspirational future for everybody."</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk quit his advisory positions on June 1, the day after Trump said the United States would leave the Paris climate agreement.</p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Musk started dating artist Grimes in May 2018. (born Claire Boucher). In that same month, Grimes said that she had changed her name to the letter "c," which stands for the speed of light, allegedly with Musk's support. Fans of the feminist musician attacked her for dating a millionaire whose business was dubbed a "predator zone" after allegations of sexual harassment.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a March 2019 profile in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-life-and-death-of-grimes-11553084548"> the Wall Street Journal Magazine </a>, the pair talked about their affection for one another. Grimes said, "Look, I love him, he's great...I mean, he's a super-interesting goddamn guy." Musk said, "I appreciate c's crazy fae creative imagination and hyper-intense work ethic."</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;On May 4, 2020, Grimes gave birth to their baby, who they called "X A-12," as Musk announced. The couple said they were renaming their kid "X A-Xii" later in the month when it was reported that the State of California wouldn't allow a name containing a number.</p>
