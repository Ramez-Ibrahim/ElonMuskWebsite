  <h2 id="Childhood and Family">&nbsp; Freemium </h2>
  <p> &nbsp; The freemium business model is a strategy where a company offers a basic version of its product or service for free while charging for more advanced features or additional resources. The goal is to attract consumers and create a customer base, then convince part of that base that the advanced features are worth the investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp; This model is often identified as the “business model of the Internet” because it is common to offer something for free with a small customer acquisition cost but potential sales growth in the long run. Some examples of companies that use this model include Skype, LinkedIn, and Spotify.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The success of this model depends on carefully designing both the free and premium proposals so that both products are desirable. It is also essential to calculate what ratio between free and premium options is necessary to make the business financially healthy</p>
<p>&nbsp; Some other companies that use the freemium business model include Dropbox, Evernote, MailChimp, Slack, and Asana. These companies offer a basic version of their product for free while charging for more advanced features or additional resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Spotify is a music streaming service that uses a freemium business model. They offer a basic version of their service for free, which includes ads and limited features. Users can upgrade to a premium version that removes ads and offers additional features such as offline listening and higher audio quality</p>
<p>&nbsp; YouTube also uses a freemium business model. They offer a basic version of their service for free, which includes ads. Users can upgrade to YouTube Premium, which removes ads and offers additional features such as offline viewing and access to exclusive content</p>

  <h2 id="Life-Changing Events">&nbsp; Amazon Associates </h2>
  <p> &nbsp; The Amazon Affiliate Program, also known as Amazon Associates, is one of the largest affiliate marketing programs in the world. It assists content creators, publishers, and bloggers in monetizing their traffic by recommending products on Amazon to their audience. Associates utilize easy link-building tools to direct their audience to their recommendations and earn from qualifying purchases and programs. </p>
  <p> &nbsp; The profitability of the program depends on various factors such as the size of the platform, consistency in content creation, and consideration of the right products to promote. According to some sources, you can expect to make around $5K/month 1 year after starting your Amazon affiliate hustle if you are consistent with your content creation. </p>
  <p> &nbsp; The business model of the Amazon Associates Program is based on affiliate marketing. This means that Amazon pays a commission to affiliate websites for sending traffic and/or sales to Amazon through customized linking tools.</p>
  <p> &nbsp; Affiliates earn up to 10% in associate commissions from qualifying purchases and programs. The commission income for qualifying purchases and programs differs based on the product category.</p>
